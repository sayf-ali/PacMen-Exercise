# PacMen-Exercise

PacMen Exercise is a project that largely uses JavaScript and some CSS to display buttons that use a factory to produce and animate Blue Ghosts that randomly move across the screen; as well as activate a PacMan game piece that moves back and forth horizontally across the screen.  Open source code was used as a starter. Some of the following enhancements were added:

1. Added blue **Background Color** to the buttons.
2. Created **"Blue Ghost Factory"**. 

# How to Run the Files
1. Cick the GREEN “Code” button on the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repository page.
2. Click Download Zip to download the repository files to your local machine.
3. Extract files from the Eye-Exercise repository Zip folder.
4. Drag and drop the index.html file to any browser.


# Future Enhancements
1. Add random factory to generate other color Ghosts.
2. Add canvas to set boundaries and board animation.
3. Add obstacles for PacMan to navigate.
4. Add collision functionality between PacMan and Ghosts that stops the game.
5. Add controllers for PacMan game piece to dodge Ghosts.
6. Add titles and some "donk" sound effects upon collision.
7. Add timer and game points.
